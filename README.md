# Algorithms
Created Approximately 1/2017

## Purpose
Javascript algorithms done for practice early in my career. Partially to increase my skills, partially to have some I could put on my first portfolio. Most if not all of these algrithms are done without most of the built in methods. Some problems are from fellow coders, codingWars, and a Coding Dojo algorithm book. I'm using Algorithm Challenges, The Dojo Collection by Martin Puryear, version 1.0.6, so any page numbers are referencing this.

# Algorithms
Algorithms using mainly javascript for practice, gotta keep the skills sharp. I will do most if not all of these algrithms without most of the built in methods. Some problems are from fellow coders, codingWars, and an the Coding Dojo algorithm book. I'm using Algorithm Challenges, The Dojo Collection by Martin Puryear, version 1.0.6, so any page numbers are referencing this.
